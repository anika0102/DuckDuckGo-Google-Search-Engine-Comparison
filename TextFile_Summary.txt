Compared DuckDuckGo performance against Google's dataset using set of queries.
After analyzing the results, I found that the:

1.Percent overlap between DuckDuckGo and Google was only 25.3%, indicating that just around 25% of URLs were common across both search engines.
2.Additionally, the average Spearman coefficient was 0.009, reflecting a weak alignment between the rankings of both engines.
3.Given that DuckDuckGo produced significantly different results from Google and performed worse in terms of both overlap and ranking consistency
